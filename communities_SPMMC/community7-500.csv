On Thursday, the government of Belarus cleared a large migrant camp at its main border entry point with Poland, The New York Times reports. Migrants at the Polish-Belarusian border have faced freezing and life-threatening conditions throughout the standoff, according to The Wall Street Journal, and this move from Belarus is expected to ease some tensions that have escalated to violence in the last few weeks. Throughout the standoff, the EU has claimed Belarus pushed migrants to the border with Poland for political purposes, while Belarus has said Europe is at fault for the situation, according to WSJ and Reuters.""}}, {""domain"": {""id"": ""29"", ""name"": ""Events [Entity Service]"", ""description"": ""Entity Service related Events domain""}, ""entity"": {""id"": ""1483255084750282753"", ""name"": ""Latest updates on the war in Ukraine"", ""description"": ""On February 24, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea after months of tensions between Moscow and Kyiv.
